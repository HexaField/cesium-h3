# cesium-h3

A minimal demo that renders H3 hexagons on a Cesium globe using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind.

What it does

- Computes H3 hexagons from geographic coordinates using `h3-js`.
- Renders those hexagons on a Cesium globe as entities/overlays.
- Includes example components in `src/components/` (for example `H3Layer.tsx` and `CesiumGlobe.tsx`).
